Hello world! We are back after a long absence with more stories to share
about our student life in the MSNE program. At this point it seems
appropriate to start off by introducing ourselves, the 4th batch of MSNE
students.

Our cohort, just like the previous ones, comes from all around the
globe: be it Brazil and South Korea, India and Italy, the US and
Germany, and many, many more. What brings us together in Munich is a
shared goal of defining new frontiers in neuroscience through
engineering training or vice versa - using an understanding of the brain
to advance in complex engineering problems. Now that the first semester
is ending, we can look back on our experiences during our first few
months as fledgling Neuroengineering students.

The MSNE program is a very interdisciplinary program, and professors
from different faculties and universities are involved in our classes.
As a consequence of this, we spent a great part of our semester
exploring Munich's underground in the U-Bahn, seeing everyday life in
Munich while going back and forth between research facilities and class
rooms. In the midst of all our traveling, when not learning about how
far the U2 and U6 can go, we learned about the field of Neuroengineering
from various perspectives, ranging from the electronics and methods to
analyse neuronal activity to the structures and computations encompassed
in our brain.

### The ENB Welcome Event
Throughout the semester we were faced with logistical and mental hurdles
alike. However, aside from the challenges during our daily routines we
managed to attend various events; noteworthy among those was the Welcome
Event organised by the [Elite Network of Bavaria](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/elite-network-home/elitefoerderung/?L=2). Presentations from the
network coordinators gave us a glimpse into the variety of opportunities
that the ENB offers us in addition to our studies. Further, alumni and
experts invited by ENB provided us with perspectives to shape our own
career outside academia by presenting examples and issues in
entrepreneurship. At the end of the event we were given the possibility
to engage with peer students from the network. We ended our evening
together on Vorhoelzer Forum with a pleasant view over Munich at night.

### Visit to Texas Instruments
Another event worth noting was our visit to Texas Instruments in
Freising, organised by [Prof. Wolfrum](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wolfrum-bernhard/). Our visit to TI helped us learn
something that is not necessarily taught in our classes: the ability to
balance scientific innovation with its economic potential. With a round
of presentations from young professionals and experts from the company
we were able to delve into the decisions that the industry faces on a
daily basis. Apart from presentations, the program also included a
guided tour through the test laboratory of TI. All in all, it was a very
insightful visit that served as a contrast to our regular study program.

This was more or less a recap of the previous months in the MSNE
program. Stay tuned for more updates...
