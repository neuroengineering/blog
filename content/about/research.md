  [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Kay Tye's Systems Neuroscience lab, Cambridge MA](https://tyelab.mit.edu/){{< break >}}
  I was in Dr. Kay Tye‘s lab for 6 months. I joined a project studying the role of Neurotensin, a neuropeptide on positive and negative associative learning. I learned techniques such as RNAscope in-situ hybridization, stereotaxic surgery, and head-fixed behavior with mice. {{< break >}}
  *Time scope: 9 week project, beginning on March 01, 2018*{{< break >}}
